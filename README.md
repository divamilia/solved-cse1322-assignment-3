<strong><u>Module 3A Pseudocode Assignment </u></strong>

For the problem statement below, you must write the Pseudocode for each part of the solution.  The Pseudocode must be complete and following the standards listed at <a href="https://kennesawedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/dtatum7_kennesaw_edu/Documents/9.%20Capstone%20project%20final%20acceptance%20and%20assessment%20Hackthon%20Registration%20-%20Dawn%20Tatum.docx?web=1">http://ccse.kennesaw.edu/fye/Pseudocode.php</a>

<strong><u>Problem Statement</u></strong>:

Create an application that acts as a simple calculator.  Create buttons for 0-9 and a text field that displays the concatenation of the current digits as they are clicked.  Add buttons for operators “+”, “-“, “*”, and “/”.  Add a final button for “=” that calculates the computed value with the value entered in the text field.  For instance, clicking buttons 7, +, 8, =  one-by-one and then it should display 15.

<strong><u>Break the problem down and write the pseudocode: </u></strong>

Break the problem statement into parts to fully understand what is expected as input, output and processes in your code.  Write down all the variables you will need from the problem statement.  Once you have broken down the problem, start writing your pseudocode.

Writing the pseudocode may take a while and several iterations to fully get the solution complete.  Walk through the problem and your pseudocode as if the program is running.

Now make sure that your code is the best it can be.

Check your formatting, comments, and make sure your output is correct and communicates what is happening in your code.

<strong><u>Module 3B – Coding Assignment </u></strong>

For the problem statement below, you must review the Pseudocode for each part of the solution.  You will then write your code based on the feedback from your Pseudocode assignment.

<strong><u> </u></strong>




<strong><u>Start writing the code from your pseudocode:</u></strong>

Code the solution from your pseudocode. Compile and debug all parts of your program to ensure it is correct.




<strong><u>Test</u></strong>

Now make sure that your code is the best it can be.

Check your formatting, comments, and make sure your output is correct and communicates what is happening in your code.
